<p> 
Working on the IPL 2022 dataset was an absolute joy as I have a penchant for both sports and analytics. I was keen to learn Plotly and found the perfect opportunity to get my hands dirty.<br> 
</p>
<p> I have based my analysis on the following parameters: <br>
<ol>
   <li> Toss Decision - overall </li>
   <li> Time of start of games </li>
   <li> Matches batted and bowled - Per team </li>
   <li> Games won for each decision - Per team </li>
   <li> Powerplay Analysis - Runs Scored </li>
   <li> Batsmen Analysis - In three phases of the game </li>
   <li> Bowlers Analysis - In three phases of the game </li>
</ol>
